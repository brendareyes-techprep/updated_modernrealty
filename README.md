# Modern Realty
## This is the functional specification for the Modern Realty website.

### Upon talking to John all I was told was that.
1. It must contain their photos, mock up will not have those.
2. Pricing should not be easily found, must click around to find. 
3. Booking link can be added.

### Pain points
- I want to be able to show off my business, showing my work, pricing, and the ability to contact me. 

### I do not have a domain model for this.
- Will not have any complex logic. 

### These are the mock ups that I have come up with.

This is the one John liked.

- I am a realtor and I would like to see pricing.
- I am a realtor. I have a question about a special work, how can I contact them.
- I am a business owner, I would like the pricing to be hidden.
- I am a business owner, I would like the display to be clean
- I am a business owner, I would like the main audience to be realtor but not limited to
